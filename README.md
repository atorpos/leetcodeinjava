## **Introduction**
This repository contains a Java implementation of the famous **FizzBuzz** problem. It also demonstrates Java basics, including:
- Use of loops
- String manipulation
- Modular programming with separate classes

The program calculates the FizzBuzz sequence for a given range and outputs corresponding results:
- Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with `"Fizz"`.
- Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with `"Buzz"`.
- Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with `"FizzBuzz"`.

## **Features**
- Calculates FizzBuzz for a defined range of numbers.
- Demonstrates modular class usage with separate files.
- Beginner-friendly code with clear comments.
- Easy to understand and extend for further functionality.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Language**: Java 21
- **Build Tools**: None (pure Java implementation, but you can integrate with Gradle or Maven if needed)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)

## **Project Structure**
The project consists of two main files:
``` 
src/
 â”œâ”€â”€ org.fxexchange/
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ FizzBuzz.java   // The main Java file containing the main() method
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Helper.java     // A helper class with additional functionality
```
1. **FizzBuzz.java**
    - Contains the `main()` method for execution.
    - Implements the FizzBuzz logic in a function that takes the range as input.

2. **Helper.java**
    - A modular class used to provide helper methods (e.g., printing messages).

## **How to Run**
Follow these steps to clone and run the project:
### **Clone the Repository**
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
``` 
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```
1. Navigate to the project directory:
``` 
   cd your-repo-name
```
### **Run the Application**
#### Using an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA)
1. Open the project folder in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Navigate to `FizzBuzz.java`.
3. Click the **Run** button next to the `main` method.

#### Using Command Line
1. Compile the files:
``` bash
   javac org/fxexchange/FizzBuzz.java org/fxexchange/Helper.java
```
1. Run the main class:
``` bash
   java org.fxexchange.FizzBuzz
```
## **Examples**
Hereâ€™s what the program does:
1. The `FizzBuzz` function takes a number `n` (e.g., 15).
2. It prints:
``` 
   [1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz]
```
### **Usage of Helper Class**
The `Helper` class also demonstrates modular usage:
- You can use it to print custom messages.

For example:
``` java
Helper helper = new Helper();
helper.printMessage("Running the FizzBuzz program!");
```
